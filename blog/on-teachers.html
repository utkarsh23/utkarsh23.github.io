                <p>As I write this, I find myself in the fourth day of mourning my grandfather's passing. His death
                    resulted from multiple brain hemorrhages.</p>
                <p>When I think of my grandfather, the words "teacher" and "professor" immediately come to mind. He was
                    a Biology professor at Pratap College in Amalner, a small town nestled along the banks of the Bori
                    River in Maharashtra. For years, Amalner has served as a significant educational hub for neighboring
                    cities and towns. His students admired him for various reasons, but primarily for his exceptional
                    teaching skills and calm demeanor.</p>
                <p>Like many professors, my grandfather held private tuition sessions at home to supplement his income.
                    How much extra income? I researched and concluded that it didn't matter; the pay range for teachers
                    is abysmally low in India. Consider this stark illustration of teacher salaries across various
                    countries worldwide:</p>
                <div class="chart-wrapper"><canvas id="avg-annual-pay-chart"></canvas></div>
                <p>I realize that this perspective is overly simplistic, and a real in-depth analysis would
                    include statistics broken down by experience, subject matter, and the level of students (class of
                    school or year of college). It is also important to consider the relative pay-per-capita in
                    comparison with other professions in the country. While all of these points are indeed valid, most
                    of us can agree that teachers are not compensated fairly.</p>
                <p>Why don‚Äôt we give the folks we call our "gurus" a respectable wage? Why are researchers so poorly
                    funded? How has the teaching profession stooped to such lows? I firmly believe that the brightest
                    minds in every profession should be encouraged to pursue teaching and training roles. Of course,
                    there‚Äôs the question of whether all subject-matter experts excel at the art of teaching. This is a
                    spicy topic that could fuel hours of debate. Finding individuals who are both exceptional subject
                    matter experts and effective teachers is indeed a small subset and unlikely to meet India's massive
                    demand for educators. However, we can all agree that students are more likely to listen to someone
                    they respect and admire.</p>
                <p>True teachers cherish the opportunity to explain concepts and witness their students' understanding.
                    Teaching is an art ‚Äî a creative and fulfilling endeavor that is often one of humanity's
                    lesser-appreciated experiences. Engaging with another individual in the process of explaining,
                    exchanging ideas, thinking critically, and debating back-and-forth can lead to those occasional
                    "lightbulb" moments. These "lightbulb" moments are delightful experiences that teachers long to see
                    in their students. They occur when students grapple with various complex and sometimes conflicting
                    ideas, ultimately fitting together just right in their minds. This revelation unveils the bigger
                    picture, putting to rest doubts, hesitations, and questions.</p>
                <p>My contrarian take on teaching stems from the ideas presented above: The responsibility for effective
                    learning lies equally with the teacher, if not more so than with the student. If students lack
                    interest in a subject, it is invariably the teacher's responsibility to present it in an engaging
                    manner. For instance, many individuals struggle to appreciate the inherent beauty of mathematics;
                    however, conversing with mathematicians reveals various ways they find satisfaction and pleasure
                    within their discipline. I am reminded of a lecture from professor Walter Lewin, who put
                    his life on the line to explain a physics concept to his students. Watch the video below:</p>

                <p>Teaching is one of humanity's most noble professions. While this essay primarily discusses classroom
                    teachers, I have found that some of the best educators are those in workplace settings without
                    formal teaching titles. These individuals‚Äîcolleagues, team leaders, or managers ‚Äî excel in their
                    crafts and inspire those around them to push boundaries and strive for greatness.</p>
                <p>This spirit of mentorship and dedication to education was vividly embodied by my grandpa. My mom
                    and grandma often told me that his study notes were famously regarded as some of the best in the
                    region. This reputation led many students to line up at his house, eager to join his private tuition
                    sessions. My grandfather once shared how many students couldn't afford their fees, yet he welcomed
                    them into his classes without hesitation. His actions were not merely about helping those in need;
                    rather, he believed that while fees might be negotiable, the value of learning was not.</p>
                <p>- Dedicated to Prof. D. S. Patil, my loving grandpa. Om Shanti. üôè</p>
